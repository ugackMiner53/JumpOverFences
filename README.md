# JumpOverFences

An open-source fork of https://dilaton.martmists.com/Martmists/JumpOverFences updated to 1.18.1

It allows you to jump over fences and walls, it only needs to be installed client-side, but server-side can prevent this mod from working.

## Why a Fork?

Martmists changed all of the licenses of his mods from MIT to a very restrictive license. This is a continuation of the mod from when it was open source, in an effort to preserve user and developer freedom.
